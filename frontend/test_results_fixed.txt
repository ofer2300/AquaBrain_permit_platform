⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: React Router will begin wrapping state updates in `React.startTransition` in v7. You can use the `v7_startTransition` future flag to opt-in early. For more information, see https://reactrouter.com/v6/upgrading/future#v7_starttransition.
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: Relative route resolution within Splat routes is changing in v7. You can use the `v7_relativeSplatPath` future flag to opt-in early. For more information, see https://reactrouter.com/v6/upgrading/future#v7_relativesplatpath.
Warning: An update to DashboardPage inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://reactjs.org/link/wrap-tests-with-act
